# Disdoc

Disdoc is a Discord bot that answers questions over documents without hiding the documents.

While originally intended for advanced Computer Science courses, it is structured to work with any Q&A application, as long as you provide the documents and LLM.

In order to run, Disdoc needs three things:

1. Documents to use for Q&A, typically collected using a [web scraper](https://github.com/brdoney/cs3214-scraper)
2. The Discord bot (this repository)
3. [A data collection API and frontend](https://github.com/brdoney/thesis-api)

## Research

This is part of a set of repositories for my Master's thesis at Virginia Tech. The complete list of repositories is as follows:

- Discord bot (you are here)
- [Web scraper](https://github.com/brdoney/cs3214-scraper)
- [Backend and frontend](https://github.com/brdoney/thesis-api)
- [Analysis scripts](https://github.com/brdoney/thesis-analysis)
